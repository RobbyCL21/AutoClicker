Welcome to the Autoclicker program

Step 1: The IMPORTS

# TIME

We will need the sleep function to because python can not just run a click over and over again , it needs a moment
to pause and take a break so we import time for the sleep

# THREADING

We need to run 2 functions at the same time so we need to use threading so we can have those 2 codes run together:
1. To click when u press your button 
2. To check if you press the button or not because else we will not be able to stop it again 

# PYNPUT 

With this code we can then talk to the mouse and the keyboard to check what key and which mouse click ( left or right )

Step 2: TOGGLE KEY DEFINITION AND CLICKING BASICS
